## Patching and configuration

### Patching 

#### Workflow

- **Swallow**: replaces the terminal with the launched app (and returns the terminal when the app closes).
- **Autostart**: allows running scripts when dwm starts.

- **RestartSig**: restarts dwm without logging out of the session.

- **MoveStack**: reorders windows in the stack with keybindings.

- **CycleLayouts**: cycles through layouts in sequence.

- **AttachAside**: new windows open next to the master area.

- **PerTag**: each tag saves its layout/configuration.

- **Warp**: moves the pointer to the window selected via keyboard.

- **SaveFloats**: remembers position/size of floating windows.

- **MoveResize**: move/resize floating windows with the keyboard.

- **RotateTags**: rotate tags left/right.

#### Aestethics

- **VanityGaps**: gaps between windows and additional layouts.
- **ActualFullScreen**: true fullscreen for the master window.
- **NoBorder**: hide borders when there is only one window.
- **ColorBar**: change fg/bg colors of bar elements.
- **Status2d**: colors in the statusbar using escape sequences.
- **UnderlineTags**: underline the active tag.
- **NoTitle**: remove titles from the bar.
- **BarHeight**: adjust the height of the bar.
- **BarPadding**: extra padding in the bar.
- **AlwaysCenter**: floating windows appear centered.
- **Xresources**: manage options from `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/X11/Xresources`.
- **TagColorScheme**: color scheme per tag instead of boxed tags.
- **ToggleFloatingCenter**: keybinding to center floating windows.

#### How to apply a patch manually:

```bash
cd dwm-btw
patch -p1 < ../patches/name-patch.diff
sudo make clean install 
```

## Notes

- If you keep a config.h in the folder, it will override config.def.h at compile time. If you want a clean start, remove config.h or regenerate it from config.def.h.

- If make install complains about missing headers, install the -dev packages for your distro.

- To make the bar read colors from Xresources, ensure you load .Xresources with xrdb ~/.Xresources before starting dwm.
